## Project
Color is a fundamental element of user experienceâ€”capable of evoking emotion, guiding attention, and shaping brand identity. Yet crafting a palette that is both visually harmonious **and** meets strict accessibility standards can be time-consuming and tedious.

**ChromaGen** is an AI-powered web tool that streamlines this process.  
Using prompts, ChromaGen generates complete, ready-to-use color palettes **automatically checked for WCAG accessibility compliance**. Designers and developers can focus on creativity while the system ensures great color choices.

Where can this be used?
This can be used by Web Developers/Mobile Developers to check which color will look better over the other, plus it will give them a preview on how to color code their app.

- **Structured Output** â€“ Each color is labeled with a role (Primary, Secondary, Accent) plus HEX, RGB, and HSL codes for easy copy/paste.
- **Automated Accessibility Auditing** â€“ Built-in WCAG AA/AAA contrast checks and color-blindness simulations (protanopia, deuteranopia, tritanopia).
- **Preview** - With the colors returned by the API, a preview iwll be generated which can be used by developers to make their applications.
