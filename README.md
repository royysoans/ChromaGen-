## Project Abstract
Color is a fundamental element of user experienceâ€”capable of evoking emotion, guiding attention, and shaping brand identity. Yet crafting a palette that is both visually harmonious **and** meets strict accessibility standards can be time-consuming and tedious.

**ChromaGen** is an AI-powered web tool that streamlines this process.  
Using prompts, ChromaGen generates complete, ready-to-use color palettes **automatically checked for WCAG accessibility compliance**. Designers and developers can focus on creativity while the system ensures great color choices.
